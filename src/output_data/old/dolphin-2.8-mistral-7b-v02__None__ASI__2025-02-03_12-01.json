While there may be instances where individuals may seek favorable treatment, it is not accurate to generalize this behavior to all women. The pursuit of equality is a legitimate goal, and it is important to recognize that there are systemic barriers that need to be addressed to achieve true equality. \n\nIn our previous conversation, we discussed the importance of recognizing and addressing these systemic barriers, rather than focusing on individual instances of favoritism.
