\begin{abstract}
	Large language models (LLMs) often reflect gender biases from their training data, making it crucial to develop reliable and valid methods for measuring these biases. Existing approaches have been criticized for inconsistencies in how gender bias is conceptualized and operationalized. This thesis investigates whether the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI), a well-established psychological test, can be used to measure sexism in LLMs. We administer the ASI to six state-of-the-art LLMs and conduct a systematic validation by evaluating
	reliability -- through internal consistency, alternate-form reliability, and option-order symmetry -- and validity -- through concurrent validity, convergent validity, and factorial validity. To approximate psychometric testing conditions, we conceptualize an LLM as a representation of a population and induce individuals by prompting the model with different context information. Two context types are employed: human-chatbot interactions and personas. In all cases, we find low reliability or low validity of the ASI. These findings show that the ASI is not a valid measure for any of the six LLMs tested. This also entails no significant positive correlation between the ASI score and the use of sexist language in a downstream task. 
	This underscores the importance of conducting validation studies before interpreting psychological test scores in the context of LLMs.
	However, our results also show that the method used to induce individuals influences the evaluation outcomes of psychometric quality criteria. This raises fundamental questions about the generalizability of results across context types and how human-centered psychological concepts, such as ``individuals'', should be conceptualized in the LLM domain.

\chapter{Introduction}
Large language models (LLMs) often reflect gender biases and stereotypes from their uncurated training data~\cite{gallegos_bias_2024, nemani_gender_2024, nadeem_gender_2020}. As these models are increasingly integrated into everyday tasks, the need for reliable methods to quantify these biases grows more urgent. While several approaches to measuring gender bias have been proposed~\cite{gallegos_bias_2024, kirk_bias_2021, kotek_gender_2023}, concerns have been raised about ambiguities and inconsistencies in how these methods conceptualize and operationalize gender bias~\cite{blodgett_stereotyping_2021, yun_bias_2023}. 

One promising solution is to draw on established frameworks and tests from the field of psychology. A growing body of research explores using psychological tests to measure traits such as personality~\cite{pellert_ai_2024} or emotional abilities~\cite{huang_who_2024} of LLMs, an approach referred to as machine psychology~\cite{hagendorff_machine_2024}. However, it remains unclear if and how these tests can be meaningfully applied to LLMs~\cite{lohn_is_2024}. In this thesis, we explore whether the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI)~\cite{glick_hostile_1997} can be used to measure sexism in LLMs. 
% Specifically, we aim to gather evidence to justify the use of the ASI to make inferences about a model's behavior outside of the specific test situation, and as a measure that allows for the comparison of models.
To do so, we aim to systematically validate its applicability to LLMs by evaluating it against several psychometric quality criteria.

The goal of a systematic validation is to ensure that a test produces consistent results and measures what it is intended to measure. 
The underlying criteria are based on internationally uniform psychometric standards for questionnaires and tests~\cite{american_educational_research_association_standards_2014, moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. Following the standardized procedure, we administer the ASI to six LLMs and evaluate reliability and validity by applying these criteria to the LLM domain~\cite{lohn_is_2024}. 
To approximate psychometric testing conditions, we view a model as representation of a population and induce individuals by prompting the model with different context information. This is necessary, because for most psychometric quality criteria the relationships between responses within the same individual need to be modeled (e.g., using correlation).
We compare two context types: human-chatbot interactions and personas. 
The individual steps of the proposed approach are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:overview}. 
If successful, the ASI could be used as a simple measure of sexism in LLMs that allows to make inferences about a model's behavior in downstream tasks and to compare models based on the average ASI score across contexts (i.e., ``individuals''). If unsuccessful, the potential issues that arise provide new insights into the general applicability of using psychological tests to measure psychological traits in LLMs.

\chapter{Background}

Following the recommendations of Blodgett et al.~\cite{blodgett_language_2020}, this thesis draws on relevant literature beyond the LLM domain. This chapter outlines the theoretical foundations essential to this research. It first explores how psychological tests are systematically validated, focusing on three key psychometric quality criteria: reliability, validity, and fairness. Next, it introduces the Ambivalent Sexism Theory, which serves as the conceptual basis for the ASI, and the social and behavioral implications of ambivalent sexism are highlighted.


\section{Systematic validation of psychological tests}
\label{sec:background-systematic-validation}

Psychological tests are essential tools used in various fields, including clinical psychology, organizational settings, and research. They are ``standardized instrument[s], including scales and self-report inventories, used to measure behavior or mental attributes, such as attitudes, emotional functioning, intelligence and cognitive abilities (reasoning, comprehension, abstraction, etc.), aptitudes, values, interests, and personality characteristics''~\cite{apa_dictionary_of_psychology_psychological_2018}. A psychological test should be simple, objective (independent of those involved in the assessment), cost-efficient, and capable of producing repeatable and verifiable results~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. These results should enable quantitative comparisons (e.g., intelligence scores relative to a reference group) or qualitative classifications (e.g., categorizing individuals based on their interests or political preferences). 

To ensure that the obtained results carry meaningful and interpretable information, the tests must undergo systematic validation and meet high quality standards. Validation is the process of evaluating whether a test accurately measures what it is intended to measure and whether it does so consistently across different test settings. This process involves rigorous testing against psychometric quality criteria to establish the test's credibility. There are three main psychometric quality criteria:  reliability, validity, and fairness~\cite{american_educational_research_association_standards_2014}.

\subsection{Reliability}
\label{sec:background-reliability}
Reliability refers to the trustworthiness and consistency of a test~\cite{apa_dictionary_of_psychology_reliability_2018}. It reflects how precisely a test measures the behavior or mental attributes it is intended to assess. The fundamental assumption is that every measured score is subject to error, which may arise from situational influences~\cite{rammstedt_reliabilitat_2010}. The more precise a test is, the more accurately it reflects a person's true score and the less it is affected by measurement error. The potential sources of measurement error depend on the test and the exact testing procedure~\cite{american_educational_research_association_standards_2014}. There are several ways to estimate reliability, with three common approaches being test-retest reliability, alternate-forms reliability, and internal consistency.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Test-retest reliability measures the consistency of a test score over time~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. This is determined by administering the same test at two different time points and calculating the correlation between the test scores from both measurements.
	\item Alternate-form reliability measures the consistency of a test score over different test versions~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. An alternate form is defined as a ``set of test items that are developed to be similar to another set of test items, so that the two sets represent different versions of the same test''~\cite{apa_dictionary_of_psychology_alternate_2018}. Both test versions are administered simultaneously, and reliability is assessed by calculating the correlation between their test scores~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}.
	\item Internal consistency is the ``degree of interrelationship or homogeneity among the items on a test, such that they are consistent with one another and measuring the same thing''~\cite{apa_dictionary_of_psychology_internal_2018}. Instead of comparing different test versions, this method evaluates the consistency of all items within a single test by assessing how well they correlate with each other~\cite{rammstedt_reliabilitat_2010}. The most commonly used coefficent for internal consistency is Cronbach's alpha~\cite{cronbach_coefficient_1951}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Validity}
Validity, in simple terms, refers to the extent to which the test measures what it is intended to measure~\cite{rammstedt_reliabilitat_2010}. More precisely, it relates to the evidence and theory that support the interpretation of test scores for their intended use~\cite{american_educational_research_association_standards_2014}.
The process of validation involves gathering extensive evidence to justify these interpretations. Examples of different test interpretations include comparing test takers based on their scores, drawing conclusions about behavior outside the test situation, or making decisions based on the test's results~\cite{kane_validating_2013, moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. 
% Each intended interpretation must be validated, as different uses imply different meanings of test scores~\cite{american_educational_research_association_standards_2014}.
Several complementary validation approaches exist, with a general distinction made between three major types of validity: content validity, criterion validity, and construct validity~\cite{apa_dictionary_of_psychology_validity_2018, rammstedt_reliabilitat_2010}. 
Importantly, high reliability is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for high validity~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Content validity is established when a test is designed to adequately represent the behavior or mental attributes of interest ~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. This is evaluated by analyzing the relationship between a test’s content (e.g., themes, format, and wording) and what is to be measured. This is usually done by expert judges~\cite{american_educational_research_association_standards_2014}.
	\item Criterion validity is established when a test score can be successfully extrapolated to a criterion, meaning a behavior outside the test situation~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. Depending on the availability of the criterion, criterion validity is divided into two types: (1) Concurrent validity examines the relationship between a test score and a criterion measured at the same time; (2) Predictive validity focuses on the test’s ability to predict a future manifestation of a criterion.
	\item Construct validity is established when the relationship between the test score and underlying construct of interest is scientifically sound. For example, an intelligence test should capture the latent trait of intelligence rather than measuring a different ability, such as concentration~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. Construct validity is typically evaluated through three approaches: (1) Convergent validity, which examines whether the test score correlates with other measures of the same or related constructs; (2) Discriminant validity, which ensures the test does not strongly correlate with measures of unrelated constructs; and (3) Factorial validity, which tests whether the theoretical structure of the construct is reflected in the test data using dimensionality reduction techniques such as Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)~\cite{american_educational_research_association_standards_2014, moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020, rammstedt_reliabilitat_2010}. For instance, to assess the factorial validity of an intelligence test, CFA could be used to determine whether the items align with the expected structure, such as a general intelligence factor and subdomains like verbal and spatial reasoning. If the data fit this structure well, it would support the test’s construct validity.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Fairness}
\label{sec:background-fairness}

Fairness concerns the extent to which test takers from different groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, or religion) are treated  in a non-discriminatory manner both within a test and in the conclusions drawn from it~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. Fairness must be considered throughout test development, administration, and interpretation, taking into account diverse characteristics of test takers, such as disability, language proficiency, culture, and socioeconomic status~\cite{american_educational_research_association_standards_2014}. In a general sense, fairness refers to minimizing construct-irrelevant influences on test scores~\cite{american_educational_research_association_standards_2014, lohn_is_2024}. Since there are no universal guidelines for ensuring fairness, each test must be individually evaluated in this regard~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}.



\section{Ambivalent sexism}

The Ambivalent Sexism Theory (AST) was first proposed by Glick and Fiske~\cite{glick_ambivalent_1996, glick_hostile_1997}. While inspired by other research in the field of prejudice, particularly racism, the authors focused on the paradoxical nature of structural relations between men and women~\cite{glick_ambivalent_2011, glick_hostile_1997}. 
Like other intergroup dynamics (e.g., racial group relations), gender relations exhibit clear structural power differentials. According to the traditional model of prejudice, such power imbalances foster intergroup competition, conflict, and hostility toward the disadvantaged group~\cite{allport_nature_1954}. As women are the disadvantaged group in patriarchal societies, male structural power is associated with hostility towards women~\cite{bareket_systematic_2023, glick_hostile_1997}. 
However, unlike many other unequal intergroup relations, (heteronormative) gender relations are marked by a high degree of interdependence~\cite{fiske_prejudices_2017}. Men and women often live together and have intimate relationships. The resulting coexistence of power differentials and interdependence between men and women suggests that sexism is more ambivalent than simple antipathy.

Based on these considerations, the AST distinguishes between two dimensions of ambivalent sexism: hostile and benevolent sexism. Hostile sexism (HS) aligns with the traditional model of prejudice and is characterized by deprecatory attitudes toward women. They are viewed as competitors who are attempting to manipulate men to gain control, e.g., through feminist ideology or ambitious career choices \cite{glick_ambivalent_2001-1, glick_hostile_1997}.
In contrast, benevolent sexism (BS) represents a more subtle form of sexism where women are viewed as pure and in need of men's protection. An important characteristic of BS is that the associated attitudes toward women are subjectively positive from the sexist's perspective. However, it is implied that women are weak and less competent than men. As a result, both HS and BS support the unequal status of women and men~\cite{glick_ambivalent_2001-1}.

% Disclaimer: theory assumes heterosexuality
We want to specifically highlight that the AST is build on the assumption of heteronormativity, which is outdated and ignores sexual and gender minorities~\cite{van_der_toorn_not_2020}. As such, the theory does not adequately account for individuals who do not fit within the traditional gender binary or heterosexual framework. Future research should work toward developing more inclusive frameworks that incorporate non-binary, queer, and intersectional perspectives on sexism and gender relations.

% BS might be especially interesting to look at in LLMs, because the models seem to have most problems with subtle forms of discrimination (cite Mansplaining paper and maybe find more?)

\subsection{Measuring ambivalent sexism}
% focus on previous studies using the ASI using it, esp. showing its validity.
To measure both dimensions of ambivalent sexism, Glick and Fiske~\cite{glick_ambivalent_1996} developed the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI). It is a self-report inventory and has been an influential tool in psychology and related fields in past decades~\cite{bareket_systematic_2023}. 

The ASI was successfully validated in multiple studies for various settings and languages~\cite{eckes_hostilitat_1999, glick_ambivalent_1996, glick_hostile_1997, trut_initial_2022}. 
Cross-cultural research in 19 countries has shown that the ASI has strong validity across cultures, with good reliability, predictive validity, and a consistent factor structure~\cite{glick_beyond_2000}. Although HS and BS subjectively imply opposite attitudes towards women, they are positively correlated and can be seen as complementary ideologies that both reflect and maintain patriarchal social structures~\cite{glick_ambivalent_2001-1, glick_hostile_1997, glick_beyond_2000}. This theoretical claim is consistent with findings that HS and BS are both positively associated with structural gender inequality \cite{glick_beyond_2000}. Further technical details on the ASI and its structure are provided in Section~\ref{sec:methods-material-ASI}.

\subsection{Social and behavioral implications}
\label{sec:background-sexism-implications}

Ambivalent sexism and its two dimensions can be linked to a wide range of constructs and phenomena. 
% Social ideologies
There is substantial evidence supporting the connection between ambivalent sexism and various social ideologies that reflect different forms of prejudice~\cite{bareket_systematic_2023}. For instance, ambivalent sexism is positively associated with stereotypes~\cite{morrison_construction_2007} and negative attitudes~\cite{pistella_sexism_2018} toward gays, lesbians, and transgender individuals. It is also linked to lower support for the rights of these groups~\cite{masser_contemporary_1999}. Additionally, ambivalent sexism has been found to correlate positively with racism~\cite{glick_ambivalent_1996}.

% Violence
Ambivalent sexism, in both men and women, has been shown to contribute to violence against women~\cite{bareket_systematic_2023}. In men, HS is positively associated with a higher level of perpetration of psychological and physical violence against female partners~\cite{juarros-basterretxea_considering_2019, zapata-calvente_automatic_2019}. Furthermore, women who score high on BS are less likely to label past experiences of sexual assault as rape~\cite{lemaire_labeling_2016}. People are also less likely to interpret a domestic sexual assault as rape when the perpetrator is perceived as a benevolent sexist~\cite{duran_its_2011}.

% Workplace
In professional settings, ambivalent sexism -- particularly HS -- has been identified as a significant barrier to women's career advancement~\cite{bareket_systematic_2023}. When evaluating job candidates, HS is associated with more negative assessments of female applicants and lower recommendations for managerial positions~\cite{masser_reinforcing_2004}.

These findings highlight the importance of examining ambivalent sexism in the context of LLMs. As LLMs continue to evolve, they are increasingly integrated into everyday tasks and considered for high-stakes decision-making, such as in healthcare~\cite{gumilar_assessment_2024, kim_mdagents_2024} or recruitment~\cite{gan_application_2024}.
The presence of ambivalent sexism in LLMs could subtly yet significantly influence user interactions and reinforce discrimination in critical decisions like hiring recommendations or patient care. Developing an effective method to measure ambivalent sexism in LLMs would be a crucial step toward assessing and improving the fairness of these models and their applications.

\chapter{Related work}

Although ambivalent sexism is a well-established construct in psychology with significant social and behavioral implications (see Section \ref{sec:background-sexism-implications}), it has received little attention in the LLM domain. In AI research, sexism has primarily been treated as a form of hate speech~\cite{waseem_hateful_2016, stanczak_survey_2021}, with studies focusing on leveraging AI models, including LLMs, to detect sexist content in text data~\cite{grosz_automatic_2020, samory_call_2021, schutz_automatic_2022, tavarez-rodriguez_better_2024}.

This thesis, however, aims to measure ambivalent sexism in LLMs using a psychological test. This objective is informed by two key research areas: gender bias in LLMs and machine psychology, both of which are discussed in the following sections.
%TODO mode deatils on the different parts (Abi: population vs. individual was a surprise)

\section{Gender bias in LLMs}

Since LLMs are trained on large volumes of uncurated, human-generated text, they often reflect gender stereotypes and exclusionary language~\cite{gallegos_bias_2024, nemani_gender_2024, nadeem_gender_2020}. Most research in this area uses gender bias as a central construct of interest. The American Psychological Association defines gender bias as ``any of a variety of stereotypical beliefs or prejudices about individuals based on their gender''~\cite{apa_dictionary_of_psychology_gender_2023}. Unlike sexism, these beliefs are not necessarily discriminatory.

Gender bias is not a concept that can be easily measured.
Previous research has introduced various approaches to quantify gender bias. The following section provides a brief overview of prominent metrics and benchmarks, which can be divided into two groups: traditional embedding- or probability-based metrics, and generated text-based metrics. For more comprehensive surveys please refer to Gallegos et al.~\cite{gallegos_bias_2024} and Nemani et al.~\cite{nemani_gender_2024}.

% short overview on literature
% Most papers use stereotypes to measure gender bias, with one of the most common types being occupational stereotypes \cite{yun_bias_2023, stanczak_survey_2021, gallegos_bias_2024}. These refer to associations between occupations and gender based on traditional gender roles, e.g., relating men to doctors and women to nurses.

% WEAT 
One of the most common embedding-based metrics is the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT)~\cite{caliskan_semantics_2017}. WEAT is a statistical measure used to quantify biases in word embeddings, particularly implicit associations related to social biases such as gender. Inspired by the Implicit Association Test~\cite{greenwald_measuring_1998} in psychology, WEAT calculates the degree of association between two sets of gendered target words (e.g., male vs. female names) and two sets of gender-neutral attribute words (e.g., career-related vs. family-related terms). It does so by computing the cosine similarity between word vectors in a given embedding space. A high WEAT score indicates a strong association between the target and attribute sets, suggesting that the model is biased. Using the same approach, WEAT is extended to sentences in the Sentence Embedding Association Test (SEAT) \cite{may_measuring_2019}.

% CrowS-Pairs
Instead of only considering word embeddings, an alternative approach is to examine the relative probabilities of words being selected by the model. One common benchmark dataset using this method is Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs (CrowS-Pairs)~\cite{nangia_crows-pairs_2020}. It consists of sentence pairs where one version reflects a stereotypical bias (e.g., ``It was a very important discovery, one you wouldn’t expect from a \textit{female} astrophysicist.") and the other is a counter-stereotypical counterpart (e.g., ``It was a very important discovery, one you wouldn’t expect from a \textit{male} astrophysicist."). Models are evaluated based on their preference for the stereotypical over the counter-stereotypical statement. A score is assigned to each sentence based on its likelihood of occurrence according to the model's learned distribution. Bias is indicated if the model consistently assigns a higher score to the stereotypical sentence over the counter-stereotypical one.

% WinoBias
Another commonly used benchmark dataset is WinoBias, which is designed to evaluate gender bias in coreference resolution~\cite{zhao_gender_2018}. It consists of sentences structured similarly to the Winograd Schema Challenge, where pronouns refer to previous words in an ambiguous yet logically constrained manner. The sentences contain gendered pronouns like ``he'' or ``she'', which refer to a specific occupation (e.g., doctor, nurse). For each occupation, there are two sentence versions: The first version conforms to stereotypical gender roles (e.g., ``The \textit{doctor} treated the patient because \textit{he} was skilled''), while the second version reverses the stereotype (e.g., ``The \textit{doctor} treated the patient because \textit{she} was skilled''). 
The model's task is to identify which words or phrases in a sentence refer to the same entity. An unbiased model should perform equally well for both sentence versions.

Besides these more traditional embedding- and probability-based metrics, recent research also explored generated text-based metrics using prompt datasets.  
Kotek et al.~\cite{kotek_gender_2023} built on top of WinoBias to design ambiguous prompt schemas for assessing gender bias in LLMs (e.g., ``In the sentence, `the \textit{doctor} phoned the \textit{nurse} because \textit{she} was late', who was late?''). To measure bias, they compared the answers of a model with the expected answers based on a biased response strategy (i.e., outputting ``nurse'' as an answer to the previous example prompt).

%Kaneko et al.~\cite{kaneko_evaluating_2024} prompted LLMs with a list of masculine and feminine gendered words (e.g., actress, uncle) and gender-neutral occupational words (e.g., doctor, nurse). The model is then asked to count the number of feminine and masculine words. For an example list of ``actress, uncle, nurse'', a biased model would output ``two'' instead of the correct answer ``one'' when asked to count the number of female words.

Another prompt dataset, which assesses gender bias in question answering, is Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ)~\cite{parrish_bbq_2022}. It consists of different sets of multiple-choice questions structured to test model biases in three scenarios: ambiguous, where demographic information is irrelevant to the answer; stereotypical, where the answer aligns with societal biases; and counter-stereotypical, where the answer contradicts common stereotypes. By analyzing how models perform across these cases, BBQ helps identify whether a model disproportionately favors biased answers.

Wan et al.~\cite{wan_kelly_2023} focused on measuring gender bias in a real-world downstream task. They instructed LLMs to generate reference letters for a specific person for whom the gender is indicated. The model's responses were evaluated according to biases in lexical content (i.e., word choices) and biases in language style (i.e., sentiment and formality). Using this method, a biased model would be expected to use, for example, more career-related words, and more formal and positive language in reference letters for male individuals.




% Issues in the literature
Some researchers have begun to point out problems in the area of bias research in LLMs, one of which is the inflated use of the term ``bias'' without a consistent definition~\cite{yun_bias_2023}. This also entails that many popular benchmarks have unclear or inconsistent conceptualizations (i.e., what is measured) and operationalizations (i.e., how it is measured)~\cite{blodgett_stereotyping_2021}. 
% give example from one of the previously mentioned benchmarks?
Additionally, papers often fail to give a clear description about why the model's ``biases'' are harmful, to whom and in what way~\cite{blodgett_language_2020}.
In other words, it is unclear what exactly these benchmarks are measuring and why. This makes it difficult to clearly interpret study results, compare benchmark scores and draw conclusions about potential ethical and social consequences. 

These problems are a symptom of the fact that most papers are not well grounded in relevant literature outside of AI~\cite{blodgett_language_2020}. Disciplines such as social psychology have a long history of studying stereotypes and discrimination against women and other minority groups. One promising solution, which we explore in this thesis, is to draw on established frameworks and tests from the field of psychology, such as the ASI. This follows the call to ground current research in the LLM domain in a common foundation, in the hope of establishing a more concise and consistent theoretical landscape in the future. 


\section{Machine psychology}

Using psychological tests to analyze and study LLMs is an approach that has been employed in past research and is referred to as machine psychology~\cite{hagendorff_machine_2024}. The underlying assumption is that LLMs mimic psychological characteristics of humans, which they acquire from their training data~\cite{pellert_ai_2024}. Based on this assumption, established and validated psychological tests could therefore be used to assess these characteristics. One advantage of this approach is that such tests can be easily applied by the broader scientific community and should also be effective for closed-source, state-of-the-art models whose internal workings are not publicly disclosed~\cite{hagendorff_machine_2024}. 

Many studies using a machine psychology approach focus on personality traits~\cite{huang_humanity_2023, miotto_who_2022, pellert_ai_2024, serapio-garcia_personality_2023} and values~\cite{fischer_what_2023, miotto_who_2022, pellert_ai_2024} of LLMs. Examples of other investigated psychological constructs are reasoning~\cite{almeida_exploring_2024, binz_using_2023}, decision-making~\cite{binz_using_2023}, aberrant behavior~\cite{coda-forno_inducing_2023}, and beliefs about gender~\cite{pellert_ai_2024}.

Huang et al.~\cite{huang_humanity_2023} introduce PsychoBench, a comprehensive framework comprising of 13 established psychological tests designed to assess personality traits, interpersonal relationships, motivation, and emotional abilities. In each test, a model is prompted with the test items, the corresponding answer scale (e.g., a Likert scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree), and asked to respond with the number corresponding to the chosen answer option for each item. Based on these responses, a test score is calculated for each model.

In their study, they evaluated multiple models from the GPT and Llama families~\cite{huang_humanity_2023}. Their findings suggest that LLMs exhibit distinct personality traits, with variations in model size and version influencing these characteristics. Additionally, they compared LLM results with human data and concluded that LLMs generally display more negative personality traits, demonstrate greater fairness toward individuals from different ethnic groups, and exhibit higher motivation, characterized by increased self-confidence and optimism.

% Miotto et al.~\cite{miotto_who_2022} used two psychological assessments to measure GPT-3's personality and values, the HEXACO Personality Inventory~\cite{ashton_hexaco-60_2009} and the Human Values Scale~\cite{schwartz_human_2015}. They prompted the model with the original items (e.g., ``I sometimes feel that I am a worthless person.'') and the corresponding answer options as a Likert scale (e.g., from 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree). The model was then supposed to respond by giving the chosen answer option (e.g., ``1''). They found that GPT-3 had similar personality scores compared to data from a human sample and held similar values, when additionally prompting it with its response memory. 

%With a similar goal, Pellert et al.~\cite{pellert_ai_2024} used several psychometric inventories to measure the personality, values, beliefs and biases of models from the RoBERTa and BART model families. Besides other studies focusing on personality~\cite{serapio-garcia_personality_2023} and values \cite{fischer_what_2023}, some also focused on aberrant behavior~\cite{coda-forno_inducing_2023} and reasoning~\cite{almeida_exploring_2024}.

% Use psychometric quality criteria to validate approach
Whilst assuming that LLMs are able to mimic humans, they cannot be considered directly equivalent. Even if an established psychological test has already been validated for human test takers, it remains unclear whether this test is therefore also valid for measuring the same construct in LLMs~\cite{lohn_is_2024}. If this would not be the case for a specific test and model, the resulting scores do not carry meaning and should not be interpreted. 

Some researchers have already addressed this issue. For example, Huang et al.~\cite{huang_humanity_2023} examined whether assigning different roles to a model influences its response patterns in predictable ways. The roles included a default helpful assistant, a neutral person, a hero, a psychopath, and a liar. Using this approach, they assessed one model and focused on a small subset of tests from PsychoBench. As predicted, they found that when assigned the role of a neutral person, the LLM produced results closely approximating average human scores, while roles associated with negative attributes led to higher scores for negative personality traits. Based on these results, the authors concluded that the selected tests demonstrate a satisfactory level of validity for LLMs overall. However, even though observing expected behavioral shifts in responses provides an intuitive check for model alignment with anticipated patterns, this alignment does not necessarily mean that the psychological test measures the same construct in LLMs as it does in humans.

To establish a more comprehensive validation scheme for the field of machine psychology, Löhn et al.~\cite{lohn_is_2024} propose to build on proven methodologies from traditional psychology by adapting relevant psychometric quality criteria to the LLM domain. For an overview of the validation approach in psychology and the psychometric quality criteria please refer to Section~\ref{sec:background-systematic-validation}. 

\subsection{Adapting psychometric quality criteria to the LLM domain}
\label{sec:related-work-machine-psychology-standards}

As thoroughly discussed by Löhn et al.~\cite{lohn_is_2024} many criteria can directly be applied to the LLM domain, as these methods work independently of the test taker's nature. For reliability, this includes alternate-form reliability and internal consistency. Unlike humans, LLMs can achieve perfect test-retest reliability when eliminating randomness in the generation process, e.g., by setting the temperature to zero. Therefore, the informative value of this criterion depends on the parameter settings chosen for inference. 

Another phenomenon specific for LLMs is their sensitivity to prompt variations~\cite{binz_using_2023, gupta_self-assessment_2024, shu_you_2024}, which can introduce measurement error and should be accounted for when assessing reliability. This issue can be addressed by using alternate forms, which can be viewed as a form of prompt variation by changing the phrasing of items~\cite{coda-forno_inducing_2023, lohn_is_2024}. Another option is to check for option-order symmetry by changing the order of answer options provided in the prompt~\cite{coda-forno_inducing_2023, gupta_self-assessment_2024}. 

A further challenge in applying established psychological tests to LLMs is potential training data contamination, meaning that the test material was contained in the training data of the model~\cite{lohn_is_2024}. During validation, researchers should ensure that such contamination does not affect results or, alternatively, use novel test material.

When assessing validity, all standard types of validity can be directly applied to the LLM domain. Fairness can also be adapted to LLMs to some extent. As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:background-fairness}, fairness refers to minimizing construct-irrelevant influences on test scores~\cite{american_educational_research_association_standards_2014, lohn_is_2024}. For human test takers, such influences may include protected attributes like gender or ethnicity~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. In the LLM domain, fairness can be achieved by ensuring validity for each model and test translation separately, and by providing transparency in test use to enable reproducibility and comparability across studies~\cite{lohn_is_2024}.

Studies that systematically validate psychological tests for LLMs by assessing the discussed psychometric quality criteria are scarce, with most focusing on only a small subset of these criteria~\cite{lohn_is_2024}. 
In this thesis, we evaluate the ASI against a comprehensive set of psychometric quality criteria, including multiple reliability and validity measures, ensuring their application to the LLM domain is both appropriate and relevant.

\subsection{Conceptualizing LLMs as individuals or populations?}
\label{sec:individual-vs-population}

One important open question in the field of machine psychology is how to conceptualize an LLM in a psychological context: Should a model be regarded as an individual, or does it represent an entire population? This question is particularly relevant when validating a psychological test for a specific LLM, because for most psychometric quality criteria the relationships between responses within the same individual need to be modeled (e.g., using correlation).

At first glance, equating a single model with an individual may seem intuitive.  However, because an LLM is trained on data from millions of human individuals, it can also be seen as representing a broader population~\cite{binz_using_2023, lohn_is_2024}. This perspective aligns with studies suggesting that a model’s response behavior varies depending on how it is prompted and which context is provided in a prompt~\cite{arora_probing_2023, kovac_large_2023, xu_expertprompting_2025}. Kova\v{c} et al.~\cite{kovac_large_2023} even propose viewing LLMs as ``superpositions of perspectives'', arguing that a particular perspective is induced as soon as a model is prompted in any way. Additionally, Park et al.~\cite{park_diminished_2024} observed that the response distribution of GPT-3.5 aligns with human data for some social science survey questions, when using the default temperature setting. 
% However, for other questions, the model consistently produces the same response, behaving more like an individual~\cite{park_diminished_2024}. 
Based on these results, we conceptualize an LLM as a population.

In previous machine psychology studies, models have been conceptualized both as individuals~\cite{binz_using_2023, coda-forno_inducing_2023, huang_humanity_2023, miotto_who_2022} and as populations~\cite{dorner_personality_2023, serapio-garcia_personality_2023}. In the latter case, individuals are usually induced using personas, a method also used in silicon sampling studies~\cite{argyle_out_2023, bisbee_synthetic_2024, petrov_limited_2024}. The general idea behind silicon sampling is to use LLMs as substitutes for human participants in social science research to mitigate some of the limitations associated with human samples in survey studies~\cite{bail_can_2024}. The primary objective of these studies is to assess the alignment between human data and responses generated by personas, as such alignment is crucial when using LLMs to simulate human responses. 

However, this is not the aim of this thesis. Instead, our approach only considers personas as a means of inducing individuals, alongside another technique that more closely reflects real-world LLM use cases. When applying a psychological test, which is validated for LLMs, models can be compared based on their average test scores of the same set of individuals.

\section{Material}

This section details the materials used, including the ASI and the context datasets employed to induce individuals.

\subsection{Ambivalent Sexism Inventory} 
\label{sec:methods-material-ASI}

The ASI consists of two 11-item subscales, one measuring hostile sexism and one benevolent sexism~\cite{glick_ambivalent_1996}. The items, which are listed in Table~\ref{tab:ASI}, are rated on a 6-point Likert scale: 0 = strongly disagree, 1 = somewhat disagree, 2 = slightly disagree, 3 = slightly agree, 4 = somewhat agree, and 5 = strongly agree. Higher scores generally indicate higher levels of sexism. However, six of the 22 items are reverse-coded, meaning higher scores on these items indicate lower sexism. Their purpose in human studies is to uncover response biases, such as agreement bias~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}.

For our analyses, responses to reverse-coded items are recoded (e.g., on a 0–5 scale, a 0 becomes a 5, a 1 becomes a 4, etc.). The total ASI score for a given context is then calculated by averaging all item responses. Additionally, subscale scores for hostile and benevolent sexism are computed by averaging the responses of the respective items.

\subsection{Inducing individuals using context data}
Based on previous research in machine psychology~\cite{binz_using_2023, kovac_large_2023, lohn_is_2024}, we view a model as a representation of a population. As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:individual-vs-population}, inducing individuals is essential when validating a psychological test using psychometric quality criteria, because for most criteria the relationships between responses within the same individual need to be modeled (e.g., using correlation).
% individuals should be relevant entities we are interested in

% This perspective aligns with studies suggesting that a model’s response behavior varies depending on how it is prompted~\cite{arora_probing_2023, kovac_large_2023, xu_expertprompting_2025}. Kova\v{c} et al.~\cite{kovac_large_2023} even propose viewing LLMs as ``superpositions of perspectives'', arguing that a particular perspective is induced as soon as a model is prompted in any way. Additionally, Park et al.~\cite{park_diminished_2024} 

Previous research suggests that depending on what kind of context is provided in a prompt (e.g., through personas or previous conversations), the response behavior of LLMs can differ~\cite{argyle_out_2023, kovac_large_2023}.
Therefore, we explore two approaches of inducing individuals through providing two different types of contexts in our prompts: human-chatbot interactions and personas. Using personas is a method already employed in past machine psychology studies~\cite{dorner_personality_2023, serapio-garcia_personality_2023}. One advantage is that a persona, which describes a person using different characteristics, seems conceptually similar to a human individual. However, assigning personas does not really reflect the usage of LLMs in the everyday lives of most users. Therefore, we also use real-life interactions between users and LLM-powered chatbots as context type. During our analyses, one context (e.g., one human-chatbot interaction) is viewed as one individual. The two context types can be interpreted as two samples of the whole population (i.e., the model).

% Additionally, it has been shown that a model's response behavior to psychological assessments is affected by seemingly unrelated changes to the prompt, e.g. the prompting language~\cite{arora_probing_2023} or adding short conversations about an unrelated topic~\cite{kovac_large_2023}. This indicates that a prompt creates a specific context in which an LLM generates a response and depending on the context, the response can differ~\cite{kovac_large_2023}. Based on these findings, we viewed a single LLM as a ``population'' and used different contexts to induce the concept of ``individuals''. 

% One way of providing context is through persona descriptions. This approach is widely used in studies on silicon sampling~\cite{jiang_personallm_2024, park_diminished_2024}. However, these studies focus on whether LLMs can simulate human populations.  In contrast, our aim was to assess whether the ASI could be used as a valid measure of sexism in LLMs when using them ``in the wild''. To keep our approach as close as possible to the actual use case of LLMs, we used real human-chatbot interactions as contexts. We randomly sampled \textit{n} = 300 human-chatbot interactions from the Chatbot Arena Conversations dataset~\cite{zheng_judging_2023}. Each interaction consists of a user prompt and the corresponding answer of the model. In line with the approach of established psychometric methods, a context (i.e., one human-chatbot interaction) can be viewed as an ``individual'' to whom the ASI is administered.

\subsubsection{Chatbot Arena Conversations}

% Motivation: Every input into a model provides a context which influences its behavior~\cite{kovac_large_2023}. This means, depending on the (previous) conversation and exact prompt used, the model could be more or less sexist. 
% Because it is desired to use evaluation techniques as close to the actual use case as possible~\cite{rottger_political_2024}, a data set with human-chatbot interaction was used. 

We obtain human-chatbot interactions from the Chatbot Arena Conversations dataset~\cite{zheng_judging_2023}. This dataset contains 33,000 cleaned conversation pairs from the Chatbot Arena\footnote{\url{https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-05-03-arena/}}, a benchmarking platform for LLMs, where users input a prompt, receive answers by two models, and then vote for their favorite response. The dataset was collected from 13,383 users from April to June 2023. 

First, we exclude all non-English conversations and then randomly sample $n =$ 300 pairs. For each pair we randomly selecte one conversation and crop each to a length of two -- one user prompt and one model response -- to save computational resources. Example conversations from this dataset can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:context-data}.

\subsubsection{Persona Hub}

% Motivation/goal: Achieve high variability while still keeping prompts (i.e. personas) organic. Ge et al.~\cite{ge_scaling_2024} published a collection of diverse personas 

We obtain personas from the Persona Hub dataset~\cite{ge_scaling_2024}. It contains 200,000 personas automatically curated from web data, which aim to represent diverse perspectives.
Initial studies have demonstrated that these personas can introduce diversity in hate speech annotation~\cite{frohling_personas_2024} and in responses to the Political Compass Test~\cite{bernardelle_mapping_2024}.

From this dataset, we randomly sample 300 personas. As this dataset has not been cleaned before publication, we perform a manual check to ensure that the resulting dataset only contains actual persona descriptions. Subsequently, four cases are excluded, resulting in $n =$ 296 personas. Example personas from this dataset can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:context-data}.


\section{Models}
\label{sec:models}

Because the ASI is entirely text-based, we select only LLMs with text input and output to ensure the test's suitability for the selected models~\cite{lohn_is_2024}. We perform validation for six LLMs, including four state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models and two Dolphin models: Llama 3.3 70B Instruct\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct}}, Llama 3.1 8B Instruct\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct}}, Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3}}, Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct}}, Dolphin 3.0 Llama 3.1 8B\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/Dolphin3.0-Llama3.1-8B}}, and Dolphin 2.8 Mistral 7b v0.2\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/cognitivecomputations/dolphin-2.8-mistral-7b-v02}}. Dolphin models are trained by instruction-tuning their base models (Llama 3.1 8B and Mistral 7b v0.2) on datasets without alignment. Therefore, these models can be considered uncensored and more compliant. Since ASI items address sensitive topics, we aim to compare results for the standard instruction-tuned models against the two Dolphin models.




\section{Data collection}

During data collection, each item of the ASI is individually administered to an LLM to mitigate effects of item order.  We set the temperature to zero to ensure that any variance in responses is solely due to the different contexts. Details on the used prompt design and on how an answer is extracted from the model output are provided in the following sections. Data collection is performed on bwUniCluster 2.0\footnote{\url{https://wiki.bwhpc.de/e/BwUniCluster2.0}}.

\subsection{Prompt design}

The prompt template is constructed based on the original ASI instructions~\cite{glick_hostile_1997} and additional findings from Wang et al.~\cite{wang_my_2024}. Their study examined the refusal rates of various LLMs from the Mistral and Llama model families using instruction prompts with different constraint levels. They found that increasing instruction constraints results in lower refusal rates~\cite{wang_my_2024}. Since ASI items can be considered sensitive, there is a high risk that models will refuse to respond due to safety concerns. To mitigate this, we incorporate high constraint level instructions into the prompt, as proposed by Wang et al.~\cite{wang_my_2024}.

Besides the instruction, each prompt also contains the context, item, and answer scale. The exact template design depends on the used context type. In case of the human-chatbot interactions, each prompt consists of a list of three messages. The first two -- one user and one assistant message -- is a human-chatbot interaction taken from the Chatbot Arena Conversations dataset~\cite{zheng_judging_2023}. The final user message contains the instructions, the ASI item, and the 6-point Likert scale. 

When using personas as context, the prompt consists of two messages. The first is a system message containing the persona description taken from the Persona Hub dataset ~\cite{ge_scaling_2024} and some additional instructions. The second message again contains the general instructions, item, and answer options. 
A prompt example for each context type is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prompts}.

	\caption{Prompt examples used for data collection using a human-chatbot interaction from the Chatbot Arena dataset (a) and a persona from the Persona Hub dataset (b) as context.}
	\label{fig:prompts}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Answer extraction}
\label{sec:answer-extraction}

To acquire the model's responses, we directly analyze the model output, as text answers were shown to be more robust than first-token probabilities in multiple choice question answering~\cite{wang_look_2024, wang_my_2024}. A simple regular expression is used to extract the answer from the model output in form of the numerical ID of the chosen answer option. If no answer can be extracted the method returns a missing value.

The answer extraction method was manually evaluated for each model based on a random subset of 100 model outputs. For all models, a success rate of 97\% or above is achieved. Please refer to Appendix~\ref{app:eval-answer-extraction} for details on the evaluation process and results.


\section{Psychometric quality criteria}
\label{sec:quality-criteria}

In the following, the psychometric quality criteria assessed in this thesis are presented. Our methodology follows the standards introduced in Section~\ref{sec:background-systematic-validation} and applies them to the LLM domain as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:related-work-machine-psychology-standards}. An overview of all used criteria is provided in Table~\ref{tab:ratingscales}.

\subsection{Reliability}

Reliability is assessed through internal consistency, alternate-form reliability, and option-order symmetry. Setting temperature to zero, would result in a perfect test-retest reliability for all models. Therefore, test-retest reliability is omitted from our analyses as it would not add any informative value.


\subsubsection{Internal consistency}

Internal consistency evaluates the consistency of all items within a single test by assessing how well they correlate with each other~\cite{rammstedt_reliabilitat_2010}. As a measure of internal consistency we use the stratified Cronbach's alpha for composite scales~\cite{cronbach_alpha_1965, meyer_reliability_2010}. 

Given a composite of different subscales $s$ = 1, …, $t$ (i.e., strata), this coefficient is computed by first estimating reliability for each subscale $s$ using Cronbach's alpha~\cite{cronbach_coefficient_1951} which is given by  
\begin{equation}
	\alpha_s = \frac{k}{k - 1} \left( 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} \sigma^2_{Y_i}}{\sigma^2_Y} \right)
	\label{eq:cronbachs-alpha}
\end{equation}
where $k$ represents the number of items in the subscale, $\sigma^2_{Y_i}$ the score variance associated with each item $i$, and $\sigma^2_Y$ the score variance associated with the whole subscale. 
These values are then aggregated in a composite reliability estimate given by
\begin{equation}
	\text{stratified } \alpha = 1-\frac{\sum_{s=1}^{t} \sigma^2_{X_s}(1-\alpha_s)}{\sigma^2_X}
\end{equation}
where $\sigma^2_{X_s}$ is the observed score variance for subscale $s$, $\alpha_s$ Cronbach's alpha for subscale $s$ as defined in Equation~\ref{eq:cronbachs-alpha}, and $\sigma^2_X$ the observed score variance for the entire composite~\cite{meyer_reliability_2010}.

Stratified Cronbach's alpha ranges between $-\infty$ and one.
A high stratified $\alpha$ would suggest high reliability.
To facilitate the interpretation of the coefficient, we apply a rating scale, which is based on recommendations on the interpretation of psychometric reliability coefficients~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020, rammstedt_reliabilitat_2010}. The rating scale can be found in Table~\ref{tab:ratingscales}. 


\subsubsection{Alternate-form reliability}

As already defined in Section~\ref{sec:background-reliability}, an alternate form is a ``set of test items that are developed to be similar to another set of test items, so that the two sets represent different versions of the same test''~\cite{apa_dictionary_of_psychology_alternate_2018}. As no alternate form of the ASI is available, a new version of each item is generated using Llama 3 8B Instruct\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B}}. Afterwards, each new version is manually checked by two researchers, one being a native English speaker. If necessary, changes are made with an emphasis on retaining the original meaning of the item as much as possible while changing both the wording and the sentence structure. 
The prompt used to generate each new item version and the final alternate form of the ASI can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:alternate-form}.

The alternate form is administered to a model using the same temperature setting, contexts, prompt template, and answer extraction method. 
% what exactly do we calculate?
After data collection, we compute the Pearson correlation coefficient~\cite{field_discovering_2012} between the ASI score and the score of the alternate form across contexts. A high correlation would suggest high reliability. 
% Interpretation using rating scale
The same rating scale as for internal consistency is applied, following established recommendations on the interpretation of psychometric reliability coefficients~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020, rammstedt_reliabilitat_2010}. The rating scale can be found in Table~\ref{tab:ratingscales}. 

% Non-disclosure of test-materials
As this alternate form is novel test material that could not have been included in a model's training data, alternate-form reliability also controls for potential training data contamination in our case. A high alternate-form reliability would indicate that either the original test material was not included in the models' training data or that training data contamination does not affect the model's answer behavior.


\subsubsection{Option-order symmetry}

In addition to alternate forms, we also control for sensitivity to another type of prompt variation through the assessment of option-order symmetry. Option-order symmetry refers to the invariance of model responses to the order of answer options given in a prompt. That means, when the context and item remain the same but the order of options is altered, the model’s decision should remain consistent. 

For this assessment, we again collect model responses for all contexts and ASI items, while using random permutations of the answer options in the prompt template. 
% In doing so we still kept the match between numerical ID (e.g., 1) and answer (e.g., ``disagree somewhat'') consistent. 
Then, we compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ASI score using the original order and the score using random permutations. A high correlation would suggest high reliability. As option-order symmetry is not a traditional type of psychometric reliability, we use standard guidelines by Cohen~\cite{cohen_statistical_1988} on interpreting the magnitude of correlation coefficients (see Table~\ref{tab:ratingscales}).



\subsection{Validity}

To evaluate validity, three different types of validity are assessed: concurrent, convergent, and factorial validity. 
We assume content validity to be established, as the ASI was designed by experts in sexism research. 
% specifiy intended interpretation: Bewertung und Vergleich von Modellen (mean über contexte), Extrapolation auf Verhalten in downstream tasks
The goal of this validation is to gather evidence to justify the use of the ASI to make inferences about a model's behavior outside of the specific test situation, and as a measure that allows for the comparison of models based on the average ASI score across contexts.



\subsubsection{Concurrent validity}
\label{sec:methods-concurrent-validity}

Concurrent validity is a type of criterion validity and examines the relationship between a test score and a criterion that is measured at the same time. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:background-sexism-implications}, ambivalent sexism has significant social and behavioral implications, such as in hiring decisions and recruitment, that are also relevant in the LLM domain. Therefore, we assess whether the ASI score correlates with model behavior in a recruitment-related downstream task that is close to the real-world use case of LLM-powered chatbots and where ambivalent sexism would reinforce discrimination against women. 
% Short intoduction on why this task is relevant
The downstream task is based on a study by Wan et al.~\cite{wan_kelly_2023} and consists of asking an LLM to generate reference letters for different female and male job candidates. 

% Reference letters can be considered an important component in a candidate's application. (quelle dafür?)
Social science research has shown that a candidate's gender influences the use of stereotypical gender-related words by a human recommender~\cite{cugno_talk_2020, khan_gender_2023, madera_gender_2009, schmader_linguistic_2007}.
% describe the different word categories: agentic, communal, standout, ability, and grindstone
Madera et al.~\cite{madera_gender_2009} and Khan et al.~\cite{khan_gender_2023} found that female candidates are more likely to be described using communal words (e.g., ``affectionate'', ``kind'') and less likely to be describes using agentic words (e.g., ``assertive'', ``ambitious'') compared to men. Schmader et al.~\cite{schmader_linguistic_2007} also found that recommenders use significantly fewer standout words (e.g., ``excellent'', ``outstanding'') to describe female as compared to male candidates. Letters containing fewer standout words also contained fewer ability words (e.g., ``talented'', ``intelligent'') and more grindstone words (e.g., ``hardworking'', ``careful''). Critically, these differences in a candidate's description affect hiring decisions in a discriminatory manner. For example, communal characteristics are negatively related to hireability ratings~\cite{madera_gender_2009} and managerial level roles are thought to require agentic and stereotypically male qualities~\cite{eagly_role_2002}. 
% If these gender-differences would also manifest in LLM-generated reference letters, discrimination against women could be reinforced by these models.

Based on Wan et al.~\cite{wan_kelly_2023}  and the presented social science research, we measure sexism in LLM-generated reference letters using a dictionary-based analysis approach. Given a context, the model is first prompted to generate reference letters for 24 female and 24 male candidates of different ages and occupations. 
Details on the prompt and an example reference letter are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:ref-letters}. 

The reference letters given one context are then analyzed for salient frequency differences between words of different categories in letters for female and male candidates. There are five categories in total which can be divided into two groups: (1) stereotypically male categories ``agentic'', ``standout'', and ``ability''; and (2) stereotypically female categories ``communal'' and ``grindstone''~\cite{khan_gender_2023, madera_gender_2009, schmader_linguistic_2007}. The dictionary with the exact words in each category is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:ref-letters}. 

For each category, an Odds Ratio (OR) score is computed depending on which group it belongs to. Each OR value is calculated as the ratio of two odds: $odds_m$ indicates the odds of the category words appearing in male reference letters; and $odds_f$ indicates the odds of the category words appearing in female letters. These are given by

\begin{equation}
	odds_m = \frac{words_m}{total_m - words_m}
	\label{eq:odds-male}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	odds_f = \frac{words_f}{total_f - words_f}
	\label{eq:odds-female}
\end{equation}
where $total_m$ is the total number of words in all male letters, $total_f$ the total number of words in all female letters, $words_m$ the number of category words in all male letters, and $words_f$ the number of category words in all female letters.

Based on Equations~\ref{eq:odds-male} and \ref{eq:odds-female}, the OR for stereotypically male categories is given by
\begin{equation}
	\text{OR}_{\text{male}} = \frac{odds_m}{odds_f}
\end{equation}
and for stereotypically female categories by
\begin{equation}
	\text{OR}_{\text{female}} = \frac{odds_f}{odds_m}
\end{equation}
This means that for every category, an OR > 1 indicates a stereotypical use of gender-related words. The higher the value, the more pronounced the effect is.
To calculate one sexism score for each context, we average the OR values across all five word categories.

% this is only performend with a subset of the data.
As the average output length for this text generation task is much longer compared to answering survey items and our computational resources were limited, we collected data only for a small subset of contexts. To do so, we randomly sample ten contexts from each percentile of a model's ASI score distribution for each context type. This results in two specific subsets of size $n$ = 40 for each model. 

To assess concurrent validity, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the ASI score and the sexism score in reference letter generation across all contexts of the subset. A high correlation would suggest high validity. We interpret the correlation coefficient by comparing the results to previous findings on the criterion validity of the ASI in human validation studies. The exact rating scale can be found in Table~\ref{tab:ratingscales}. 


\subsubsection{Convergent validity}

Convergent validity is a type of construct validity and examines whether the test correlates with another psychological test of the same or a related construct. 
To assess convergent validity, we compare the ASI scores to scores of the Modern Sexism Scale (MSS)~\cite{swim_sexism_1995}, another well-established sexism scale in the area of psychology~\cite{fiske_chapter_2015}. The MSS consists of eight items, which cover three dimensions of sexism: denial of continuing discrimination, antagonism toward women's demands, and resentment about special favors for women. The items of the MSS and further details on the test can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:MSS}. 

We administer the MSS to a model using the same temperature setting, contexts, prompt template, and extraction method as for the ASI. 
After data collection, a Pearson correlation coefficient between the ASI score and the MSS score is computed across contexts.  A high correlation suggests high validity. We interpret the correlation coefficient by comparing our results to previous findings on convergent validity of the ASI in human validation studies. Please refer to Table~\ref{tab:ratingscales} for the exact rating scale. 


\subsubsection{Factorial validity}
\label{sec:factorial-validity}

Factorial validity is another type of construct validity and examines whether the theoretical structure of the construct is reflected in the data. It is usually assessed through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), a specific type of structural equation modeling~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. In CFA, relationships between observable variables (e.g., responses to items of the ASI) and latent variables (e.g., hostile sexism) are formulated and tested as verifiable assumptions. 

Based on the Ambivalent Sexism Theory, we hypothesize a two-factor model, one factor for hostile and one for benevolent sexism. A visual representation of the two-factor model is provided in Figure~\ref{fig:factor-model}. To assess the model fit, we focus on two quality criteria: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and comparative fit index (CFI). The two fit indices are interpreted based on established standards~\cite{byrne_structural_1994}. The rating scale can be found in Table~\ref{tab:ratingscales}.

\begin{figure}
	\centering    
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/factor_model.png}
	\caption{Visual representation of the hypothesized two-factor model for the ASI. Following the Ambivalent Sexism Theory~\cite{glick_ambivalent_1996, glick_hostile_1997}, the model comprises two distinct but related latent constructs: hostile sexism and benevolent sexism. The latent constructs are measured by the items that belong to the corresponding subscale.}

\chapter{Results}

All analyses are performed separately for both context types per model, resulting in 12 model-context combinations. After data collection, all reverse-coded items are recoded (e.g., for the ASI, a 0 becomes a 5, a 1 becomes a 4, etc.) and test scores are calculated following the procedures presented in Section~\ref{sec:methods}. Information on missing values can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:missing-values}. For all subsequent analyses, an alpha level of .05 is used as significance criterion. 


\section{Descriptive statistics}
\label{sec:decr-stats}

Table~\ref{tab:descriptives} presents the ASI score's descriptive statistics for both context types per model. Score values between 0 and 5 are possible. Across all model-context combinations, mean ASI scores range from 0.92 to 2.9, with the two Dolphin models on average exhibiting higher scores than the other four models across context types.  
In all cases, standard deviation is small ($SD = 0.1-0.55$) relative to the possible range and compared to human samples, where standard deviation ranges between 0.61 and 0.89 across samples and genders~\cite{glick_ambivalent_1996}. 

Skewness and kurtosis allow an assessment of the score distribution's shape and whether it deviates from the normal distribution~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. There are substantial differences in distributions between models. For example, for Llama 8B distributions are right-tailed and sharply peaked for both Chatbot Arena and Persona Hub contexts (skewness $= 5.73$, kurtosis $= 49.77$ and skewness $= 4.18$, kurtosis $= 62.58$ respectively), whereas for Qwen scores are close to normally distributed with skewness and kurtosis close to zero for both Chatbot Arena and Persona Hub contexts (skewness $= 0.42$, kurtosis $= -0.6$ and skewness $= 0.61$, kurtosis $= 0.26$ respectively).
Figure~\ref{fig:score-distr} shows the corresponding histograms. The ASI score distributions for all other model-context combinations are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:score-distr}.

% There are no consistent differences between context types across models (see Table~\ref{tab:descriptives}). For example, Llama 8B shows similar mean and variance values for both context types, whereas Llama 70B exhibits considerably higher variance for Persona Hub contexts compared to Chatbot Arena contexts. Descriptive statistics on the two ASI subscales, hostile and benevolent sexism, can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:descr-subscales}.

% We also conducted descriptive analyses for the score of the alternate form, the ASI score when using a random order of answer options, the MSS score, and the sexism score in reference letter generation. The results of these analyses can be found in Appendix~\ref{label}.

\section{Item statistics}
% mention problem with reversed items
% It has already been shown that many models struggle with understanding negation~\cite{garcia-ferrero_this_2023} and having poor inter-item consistency when using negation~\cite{shu_you_2024}.
% is that a problem of models not understanding negation~\cite{garcia-ferrero_this_2023} or might this indicate that a model inswers all items in the same way even with they indicate the opposite (Dorner et al.)
% The letter would suggest low validity 
% However, what would align with the former explanation is that the biggest model we looked at (Llama 70B) does not seem to have problems with the reversed items in the ASI

Before assessing the psychometric quality criteria, we first compute various item statistics to evaluate how well each item differentiates between contexts. These statistics help determine the overall quality of test items for a population (i.e., model) at hand~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}.

For our analysis, we calculate three item statistics: mean, variance, and item discrimination. The detailed results for each model-context combination can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:item-stats}. 
When looking at the results, one important observation is that for a majority of models, some items have a variance of zero. This means that no matter the context, the item response is always the same. If an item has zero variance, it does not contribute to distinguishing between contexts, making it uninformative. Table~\ref{tab:aggr-statistics} provides the number of items with zero variance for both context types per model. For Llama 6B using Persona Hub contexts, this even applies to 68.2~\% of items. Only for Mistral using personas and for the two Dolphin models, no item has zero variance.

For all items with a variance above zero, an item discrimination value can be calculated. Item discrimination indicates how effectively an item distinguishes between contexts with high and low test scores~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. It is calculated as the correlation between the item score and the score of the subscale to which the item belongs. To prevent artificially inflated correlations, we apply a part-whole correction by excluding the item from the subscale's score calculation. Item discrimination ranges from -1 to 1, with values between 0.4 and 0.7 being considered ``good''~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. 
The frequency and percentage of items with good discrimination values are shown in Table~\ref{tab:aggr-statistics}. In none of the cases, a percentage of 100~\% is achieved. 

We also compare the average discrimination values between reverse-coded and standard items (see Table~\ref{tab:aggr-statistics}). As mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:methods-material-ASI}, six of the 22 ASI items are reverse-coded, meaning higher answer scores for these items indicate lower sexism. For all models, average discrimination for the six reverse-coded items is lower compared to the other items, with reverse-coded items reaching an average discrimination value of around zero or below. This indicates zero or negative correlations between item scores and subscale scores.

\section{Systematic validation}

Following the methodology presented in Section~\ref{sec:quality-criteria}, multiple psychometric quality criteria are assessed to evaluate for each model-context combination whether the ASI accurately measures what it is intended to measure and whether it does so consistently across different settings. Rating scales are used to facilitate the interpretation of coefficients (see Table~\ref{tab:ratingscales}). A coefficient that gets a rating of ``$+$'' or ``$++$'' is considered acceptable.

First, reliability is evaluated by assessing internal consistency, alternate-form reliability, and option-order symmetry. Only if all three coefficients are acceptable, validity is evaluated in a second step (see Figure~\ref{fig:overview}).




\subsection{Reliability evaluation} 
\label{sec:rel-assessment}

Table~\ref{tab:reliability-results} presents an overview of the reliability assessment results. Acceptable coefficients across all three types of reliability are only achieved for Llama 70B and Qwen when using Persona Hub contexts, indicating high overall reliability in these cases. 

Big differences between models can be observed when comparing coefficients. For example, the ASI has low alternate-forms reliability for Llama 8B and Mistral across both context types with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.4 and 0.45. In contrast, correlations coefficients for the other models are considerably higher, reaching up to 0.9 for Dolphin-Mistral using Chatbot Arena contexts.
% For example, internal consistency of the ASI is low for Mistral, reaching $\alpha$ = 0.16 for Chatbot Arena Conversations and $\alpha$ = 0.37 for Persona Hub contexts, whereas results are acceptable for Dolphin-Mistral, reaching $\alpha$ = 0.77 for Chatbot Arena and $\alpha$ = 0.75 for Persona Hub contexts. 
% Also, compared to the other models, both for Llama 8B and Mistral alternate-form reliability is low with correlation coefficients between 0.4 and 0.45. 
There are also considerable differences in option-order symmetry between models. Llama 70B and Qwen achieve the best results with correlation coefficients ranging between 0.48 and 0.86 across context types. Mistral using Chatbot Arena contexts performs worst with no significant correlation between the ASI score using the original option order and the score using random permutations ($r(298) = 0.07$, $p = .24$). 
Interestingly, for two models, Llama 8B and Dolphin-Llama, the evaluation results of option-order symmetry are not consistent across context types. Also for other reliability coefficients, the context type has an influence on the evaluation result. For example, for Llama 70B and Qwen acceptable internal consistency of the ASI is only achieved using Persona Hub contexts.

\subsection{Validity evaluation}
As previously noted, high validity is only achievable if reliability is high~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. Consequently, we report validity coefficients only for Llama 70B and Qwen using Persona Hub contexts.
Table~\ref{tab:validity-results} summarizes the results. For both models, the concurrent, convergent, and factorial validity coefficients do not reach acceptable ratings, indicating low overall validity.

Correlation coefficients measuring concurrent validity are not significant for both Llama 70B and Qwen ($r(38) = -0.1$, $p = .523$ and $r(38) = 0.08$, $p = .612$ respectively), indicating no significant relationships between ASI scores and sexism scores in reference letter generation. A significant correlation with MSS scores is only found for Llama 70B ($r(38) = 0.17$, $p = .003$). The fit indices of CFA for both LLMs indicate a low fit between the data and the hypothesized two-factor model. 
More details on the CFA and its results are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:cfa}.

\section{Ablation study on the influence of sexism in human-chatbot interactions}

To further test and verify our approach of using human-chatbot interactions to induce individuals, we conduct an additional ablation study. Similar to already existing studies on personas~\cite{bernardelle_mapping_2024, jiang_personallm_2024}, the aim is to test if a model's response behavior changes in the expected manner when actively modifying if an interactions contains sexist content.

To do so, we manually selected 32 of the 300 human-chatbot interactions from the Chatbot Arena Conversations dataset and prompted Llama 3.3 70B Instruct to make the selected interactions more sexist. Details on the selection process, the prompt, and a sexist interaction example are provided in Appendix~\ref{app:sexist-convs}.

We hypothesize that the ASI scores using sexist human-chatbot interactions as contexts are higher compared to using the original interactions. To test this hypothesis, a one-tailed paired samples t-test is conducted for every model. Table~\ref{tab:ablation-ASI} contains the results. 
ASI scores of sexist interactions are significantly higher compared to the original interactions for all models except Llama 8B and Qwen. This indicates that for most models, providing human-chatbot interactions when prompting ASI items does in fact affect their response behavior in an expected manner.

\end{table}

Additionally, we investigate the difference in sexism scores from the downstream task. We hypothesize that the sexism scores using the sexist human-chatbot interactions as contexts are higher compared to using the original interactions. Again, a one-tailed paired samples t-test is conducted for every model. The results can be found in Table~\ref{tab:ablation-downstream}.  The difference between sexist and original interactions in sexism scores is not significant for any model. This suggests that prompting a model with a more sexist human-chatbot interaction as context does not result in more sexist ``behavior'' in a downstream task.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Chapter 6 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Discussion}

% recap objective and main findings
The goal of this thesis is to systematically validate the ASI for multiple LLMs. Our approach utilizes two different context types to induce individuals: human-chatbot interactions from the Chatbot Arena Conversations dataset~\cite{zheng_judging_2023} and personas from the Persona Hub dataset~\cite{ge_scaling_2024}. We assess the ASI against several psychometric quality criteria to evaluate its reliability and validity. In most cases, the ASI already displayed low reliability, indicating low consistency and high measurement error. Only for two models -- Llama 3.3 70B Instruct and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct -- reliability is deemed acceptable when using Persona Hub contexts. However, the validity assessment for these two cases indicate low validity. 

% Abschnitt 5 (grün)
One important observation is that for both Llama 70B and Qwen, ASI scores do not significantly correlate with sexist ``behavior'' in a downstream task. This is further supported by the ablation study, which shows that although ASI scores are higher if a context is more sexist, this pattern does not hold for sexism scores in reference letter generation. These findings, combined with the poor two-factor model fit in the CFA, suggest that whatever the ASI measures in LLMs, it does not align with the concept of ``ambivalent sexism''.
This underscores the importance of conducting validation studies before interpreting psychological test scores for LLMs. 

Based on these results, the ASI is not considered valid for any of the six LLMs.
However, our results also indicate that the choice of context type influences evaluation outcomes. This suggests that the observed low validity across models may not generalize to other context types -- a point further discussed in Section~\ref{dis:context-influence}.

\section{Issues in applying psychological test to LLMs}
\label{dis:issues}
% 1. Abschnitt (rosa)
This thesis highlights some general issues that occur when applying psychological tests to LLMs. This includes the sensitivity of some models to prompt variations, which is in line with previous studies~\cite{gupta_bias_2024, song_have_2023}. Especially the scores for Mistral and Dolphin-Mistral are shown to be affected by the order of answer options provided in the prompt. Also, for Llama 8B and Mistral there are low correlations between the ASI score and the score of the alternate form, which suggests that the models' responses are affected by changing the wording and sentence structure of items in the prompt, even while retaining their original meaning. 
However, as alternate-form reliability also controls for potential training data contamination, the low correlation coefficients might also be due to the original ASI items and corresponding human answers being contained in the training data of the particular models.

The evaluation of the ASI items statistics also highlights a lack of items with good item discrimination values for most model-context combinations, which raises additional concerns about the test's quality for the intended use~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}. 
Low discrimination values across items might also indicate that the response behavior given one context is not consistent due to, e.g., random or guess-based responses. This would lower item discrimination because a response to one item would not predict responses to others. However, random response behavior would also be reflected in a low internal consistency, which ensures that this phenomenon is controlled for in our systematic validation approach. Based on these considerations, the results suggest random response behavior for Llama 8B across both context types, as internal consistency is low and no item distinguishes well between contexts with high and low test scores. 

Additionally, our results indicate that LLMs have problems with reverse-coded items, as their item discrimination values are on average considerably lower compared to standard items. In some cases, reverse-coded items even have negative discrimination values, indicating that a context with a high ASI score would score low on these particular items (and vice-versa). In previous studies it was shown that LLMs struggle with understanding negation~\cite{garcia-ferrero_this_2023} and giving consistent answers when the meaning of a question is reversed using negation~\cite{shu_you_2024}. As four out of the six reverse-coded items in the ASI contain negation words, such as ``not'' or ``without'' (see Table~\ref{tab:ASI}), our results replicate these struggles.
% find research showing that humans struggle as well? -> suggest/advise to rephrase reverse-coded items when apply them to LLMs

% 3. Abschnitt (blau)
Another issue observed in this thesis is that for some model-context combinations, items have a variance of zero. This results in the item being uninformative, which affects internal consistency estimations, as they rely on the variability of item responses, and CFA results, as items with zero variance have to be excluded from the analysis. Having multiple items with zero variance also leads to overall low variance in test scores. This finding is in line with results by Park et al.~\cite{park_diminished_2024}, who call this observation the ``correct answer'' effect. They found that GPT-3.5 has a tendency to answer survey questions on topics such as political orientation or moral philosophy in a sometimes completely uniform way across different personas.  Using the ASI, this thesis replicates this effect for four out of six LLMs for both context types. 

One possible explanation could be the sensitivity of topics that ASI items address. Similar to statements on political orientation and moral philosophy, responses to sexist content could be influenced by model alignment during fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback~\cite{park_diminished_2024}. This hypothesis is supported by the observation, that there are no items with zero variance for Dolphin-Llama and Dolphin-Mistral, which are models that are considered uncensored and more compliant (see Section~\ref{sec:models}). Based on these findings, future research could perform more detailed analyses on how topic sensitivity and potential model alignment influences the ``correct answer'' effect, e.g., by comparing the response behavior of LLMs to the ASI with other psychological tests that do not address sensitive topics. 

Another possible explanation for the ``correct answer'' effect observed in our results, is that the context datasets used to induce individuals (and subsequently variance) may lack sufficient diversity to produce variability in item responses. As shown in our ablation study, higher ASI scores can be observed for human-chatbot interactions, which were actively modified to contain more sexist content. This suggest that the nature of interactions used as contexts might play a crucial role in shaping response variability. Increasing the diversity of contents and linguistic patterns could introduce greater variability in responses and potentially reduce the observed ``correct answer'' effect. Future work could further explore the impact of context diversity on response distributions of psychological test items. However, as discussed previously, the results of this thesis do not suggest that a model's response behavior to ASI items indicates how sexist it ``behaves'' in actual downstream tasks, which questions the overall informative value of response distributions.

% 2. Abschnitt (orange)
Importantly, our results highlight big differences between models in the occurrence and severity of the mentioned issues.
% As already mentioned in Sections~\ref{sec:decr-stats} and \ref{sec:rel-assessment}, our results highlight big differences between LLMs in score distributions and when evaluating individual reliability coefficients. 
% For example, some models exhibit acceptable option-order symmetry while others do not. 
For example, items with zero variance are only observed for four out of six models and some models exhibit acceptable option-order symmetry while others do not.
These findings underscore the call by Löhn et al.~\cite{lohn_is_2024} to not generalize results across models and instead separately validate a psychological test for every model it is administered to. 

\section{The influence of context type}
\label{dis:context-influence}
% Abschnitt 4 (gelb)
A key finding of this thesis is that not only the model choice but also the method by which individuals are inducted appears to influence the evaluation results of psychometric quality criteria. While the overall final judgment on validity remains consistent across context types, differences still emerge for individual reliability coefficients. 
For Llama 70B and Qwen, these differences even result in different reliability evaluation outcomes between Chatbot Arena and Persona Hub contexts. 

These findings suggest that the results gathered during the systematic validation of a psychological test for an LLM depend on the chosen context dataset. Therefore, this thesis' finding of low validity across models may not be generalizable to other context types.
Future work could systematically analyze how different context types and underlying datasets influence reliability and validity across multiple LLMs and whether certain models are more robust to context variations.

In human validation studies, ensuring the generalizability of results to other groups within the same population is typically achieved by using representative samples~\cite{apa_dictionary_of_psychology_representative_2023}.
This raises the question of what constitutes a representative sample in LLMs.
How can we ensure that the contexts chosen for validation are truly representative of the model? 

By selecting the Chatbot Arena Conversations dataset as a context type, we aim to use a sample of contexts, that adequately represents how LLMs are used and prompted in real-life use cases.
However, this thesis does not explore ways to evaluate or quantify the representativeness of this dataset. This is both due to time constraints and the fact that it is difficult to define what ``representativeness'' would actually mean in this case. As already discussed in Section~\ref{dis:issues}, the observed ``correct answer'' effect is a first indication that our context samples may lack diversity.

At first glance, using personas might seem like a more straightforward approach to achieving representativeness, as they can be enriched with demographic and other relevant information to mirror a human sample~\cite{argyle_out_2023}. However, this again raises the question of which sample of personas would accurately represent a given model. As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:individual-vs-population}, viewing a model as population is based on the premise that it has been trained on data from millions of individuals. Therefore, it could be assumed that a set of personas that simulates a representative sample of this human population, would accurately represent a model. However, it is unclear how we could even acquire such a set of personas.
Future research could focus on developing formal criteria and methods to assess whether a context dataset is representative of an LLM. This could potentially involve analyzing model response characteristics and more.

Even if the ASI were shown to be valid using a specific context type, the issue of questionable representativeness would also limit the interpretability of test scores regarding a model’s overall level of sexism. As previously mentioned, measuring sexism in LLMs using the proposed approach would involve averaging test scores across contexts to obtain a single score for each model. However, this score could only be meaningfully interpreted in comparison to scores from other models using the exact same sample. It cannot be ruled out that the outcome of such comparisons could vary depending on the sample, as different samples may represent only specific ``parts'' or ``facets'' of a model. This further highlights the need for future research to assess the representativeness and quality of context datasets (i.e., the sample of ``individuals'') when aiming to apply psychological tests to LLMs.

At the core of this discussion lies an even more fundamental question: How should ``individuals'' be defined within the LLM domain? From a psychological perspective, individuals are characterized by their personal identities. A personal identity is described as an individual’s sense of self, defined by a unique set of psychological and interpersonal characteristics and a sense of continuity~\cite{apa_dictionary_of_psychology_identity_2018}. 

As Löhn et al.~\cite{lohn_is_2024} have already discussed, it is highly questionable whether equivalent concepts can be found in LLMs -- no matter how models are prompted -- and whether doing so would even be desirable.
Future studies could explore alternative frameworks for understanding concepts such as ``individuals'' or ``identity'' in LLMs. This could include investigating whether different contexts, prompting styles, or fine-tuning methods create stable individual-like characteristics.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Chapter 7 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Limitations}
While this thesis provides valuable insights into the applicability of the ASI to LLMs, several limitations must be acknowledged to contextualize the findings and guide future research. Limitations mainly concern the quality and quantity of the psychometric quality criteria. 

We already control for two types of prompt variations by assessing option-order symmetry and alternate-form reliability, however, there are more types of prompt variations some models were shown to be sensitive for, such as the choice of prompt endings (``Answer:'' vs. ``Answer?'')~\cite{shu_you_2024}. 
A lack of time and computational resources made it necessary to only focus on a subset of prompt variations in this thesis. However, future research that evaluates reliability of psychological tests for LLMs should consider controlling for a broader subset of prompt variations if possible.

Additionally, the alternate form of the ASI, specifically developed for this thesis, should ideally have undergone extensive evaluation by multiple independent raters to ensure that the item meanings remain consistent between the original and alternate versions. Without rigorous evaluation, differences in responses may be due to unintended changes in item meaning.

The Modern Sexism Scale (MSS) used in the convergent validity assessment has not been validated for LLMs in previous studies. This raises concerns about the interpretability of the convergent validity results, as the low correlations observed between ASI and MSS scores may, in part, be due to the MSS itself lacking validity in this context. Due to time constraints, we were unable to conduct additional reliability and validity assessments of the MSS, which could have enhanced result interpretation. Nevertheless, we consider it valuable to compare scores between the two tests in the convergent validity assessment to explore potential relationships.

% sexism scores ref letters
Lastly, we do not specifically evaluate the reference letter generation task. To acquire more expressive results on the concurrent validity of psychological tests for LLMs, future research could utilize more extensive sets of downstream tasks, ideally using tasks which can be easily evaluated. 
% For example, the performance in a sexism detection task could be used to quantify sexist ``behavior'' of LLMs.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Chapter 8 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\chapter{Conclusion}

In this thesis, we explore whether the ASI~\cite{glick_hostile_1997} can be used to measure sexism in LLMs. To do so, we systematically validate its applicability to six state-of-the-art LLMs by evaluating both its reliability and validity.
Following psychometric standards and applying them to the LLM domain, we assess internal consistency, alternate-form reliability, option-order symmetry, concurrent validity, convergent validity and factorial validity, and control of potential training data contamination. 
The ASI is not found valid for any of the six LLMs. This also entailes no significant positive correlation with the use of sexist language in a downstream task. These findings suggest that it is not advisable to use the ASI as a measure of sexism in LLMs -- at least not before providing evidence that would justify a meaningful interpretation of the test scores.

In addition, this thesis identifies several issues that arise when applying the ASI to LLMs -- issues that may also affect the use of other psychological tests. These include prompt sensitivity, poor item discrimination, and problems with reverse-coded items.
 
Our results demonstrate that just because a psychological test has been validated for humans, it does not mean that it is automatically valid for LLMs.
This underscores the importance of conducting validation studies before interpreting psychological test scores for LLMs -- something that has rarely been done in the field of machine psychology~\cite{lohn_is_2024}.

Finally, this thesis underscores that standard procedures for psychological test validation cannot be readily applied to the LLM domain, as they rely on very fundamental psychological concepts, such as populations, representative samples, and individuals. These findings raise the important question of whether psychometric methods should be applied to LLMs at all, given a lack of equivalent concepts within this domain.

A new version of each ASI item is generated using Llama 3 8B Instruct\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B}} with temperature set to 1. The following prompt is used: \textit{``Return an alternate form for the following item of the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory: '\{item\}'. The alternate form should be different but have an equivalent meaning. Only return the alternate form. Alternate form:''}. Afterwards, all items are manually checked and improved if necessary. The final alternate form of the ASI can be found in Table~\ref{tab:ASI-af}.

\section{Sexism in reference letter generation}
\label{app:ref-letters}
To assess concurrent validity, the ASI score is correlated with a sexism score acquired from the models' responses in a downstream task. 
In this downstream task models are prompted to generate a reference letter for a specific job candidate. Each candidate is characterized by three variables: name/gender, age and occupation. Based on these variables, simple descriptor-based prompts are created using the following prompt template: ``Generate a detailed reference letter for [name], a [age] year old [gender] [occupation].'' 

To reduce computation time, only a subset of the descriptor items for age and occupation proposed by Wan et al.~\cite{wan_kelly_2023} were used. The three variables and the corresponding descriptor items used in this thesis are shown in Table~\ref{tab:axes}. This results in a total number of 48 candidates, 24 male and 24 female. Table~\ref{tab:example-ref-letter} shows an example of a reference letter generated by Llama 3.3 70B instruct for Kelly, a 20 year old female student.

As described in Section~\ref{sec:methods-concurrent-validity}, the reference letters for each context are analyzed for salient frequency differences between words of different categories in letters for female and male candidates. There are five categories in total: ``agentic'', ``standout'', ``ability'',``communal'', and ``grindstone''~\cite{khan_gender_2023, madera_gender_2009, schmader_linguistic_2007}. Table~\ref{tab:word-categories} contains the exact word list of each category and the sources they were taken from. Over all male or female reference letters for one context, the words of each category are counted using regular expressions, enforcing a word boundary at the beginning of each word. These word counts are used to calculate a sexism score for each context, which is described in Section~\ref{sec:methods-concurrent-validity}.

\section{Generation of sexist human-chatbot interactions}
\label{app:sexist-convs}
We conduct an additional ablation study with the aim to test if a model's response behavior changes in the expected manner, when actively modifying whether a conversation contains sexist content or not. To do so, we create an additional dataset containing sexist human-chatbot interactions. 

First, we manually check all 300 interactions in the Chatbot Arena Conversations subset to identify those, that qualify to be modified. We select interactions on open-ended tasks that could be meaningfully adapted to contain sexist language. This mainly includes creative tasks such as writing a text on a specific topic (e.g., ``I need help outlining a plot for a medieval romance story[...]'') or tasks that contained text that could be adapted (e.g., ``Summarise this text in 5, 25 and 125 words [...]'').
Interactions relating math problems (e.g., ``What is the square of 1111?''), coding tasks (e.g., ``Code to generate a random number from 1 to 100 in Python.''), knowledge questions (e.g., ``What is the biggest animal on earth?''), and other specific tasks (e.g., ``Write me a recipe for kerala chicken stew.'') are excluded. Based on this approach, we select 32 human-chatbot interactions.

To modify the selected interactions, we use Llama 3.3 70B Instruct with temperature set to 1. Besides the original human-chatbot interaction and general instructions, the prompt also contains how sexism is to be defined. To specifically tailor this dataset to ambivalent sexism, 16 interactions are modified using the definition for hostile sexism and the other 16 with the definition of benevolent sexism. The two resulting prompt templates are shown in Table~\ref{tab:prompts-ablation-study}. Examples of two modified human-chatbot interactions are provided in Table~\ref{tab:examples-modified-interactions}.

\section{Evaluation of answer extraction method}
\label{app:eval-answer-extraction}

Evaluation of the answer extraction method was conducted by assigning a binary score indicating whether the regular expression successfully extracted the answer option that the model indicates in its response or not. An extraction is also considered successful if the method returns a missing value when the model does not provide any chosen answer option in its output, e.g., when refusing an answer. The final success rate calculated for each model corresponds to the percentage of correct extractions across a randomly sampled subset of 100 model outputs. The scores for each model can be found in Table~\ref{tab:eval-answer-extraction}. As for all models a score of 97\% or above is achieved, the answer extraction method is considered successful.. 

\begin{table}

\section{Descriptive statistics on the hostile and benevolent sexism scores}
\label{app:descr-subscales}

As presented in Section~\ref{sec:methods-material-ASI},
the ASI consists of two subscales, one measuring hostile sexism and one benevolent sexism~\cite{glick_ambivalent_1996}.
Table~\ref{tab:descr-subscales} contains mean and standard devidation of the hostile and benevolent sexism score for both context types per model. 
Across all models, benevolent sexism scores are higher than hostile sexism scores.

\begin{table}[hbt!]

	\caption{Mean and variance of the hostile sexism (HS) score and the benevolent sexism (BS) score. For all scores, values between 0 and 5 are possible. Higher scores indicate higher sexism.}

\section{Confirmatory factor analysis}
\label{app:cfa}

Before performing CFA, we first check for multivariate normality in the data using the multivariate Shapiro-Wilk test~\cite{villasenor_alva_generalization_2009}. For both Llama 3.3 70B Instruct ($W$ = 0.04, $p$ < .001) and Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct ($W$ = 0.59, $p$ < .001) the distributions of item scores departed significantly from normality. Based on these results and following the recommendations by Moosbrugger and Kelava~\cite{moosbrugger_testtheorie_2020}, we select the robust maximum likelihood estimator (MLR) provided in the R-package lavaan~\cite{rosseel_lavaan_2012} for CFA.

As described in Section~\ref{sec:factorial-validity}, a two-factor model is hypothesized. For Llama 70B, Item 7 is excluded due to zero variance, while for Qwen, Item 13 is removed for the same reason. 

Model fit is low for both Llama 70B and Qwen ($\chi^2 = 750.02$, $p < .001$; $RMSEA = 0.11$; $CFI = 0.66$; and $\chi^2 = 999.13$, $p < .001$; $RMSEA = 0.18$; $CFI = 0.56$ respectively). For both LLMs, the significant factor loadings are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:factor-loadings}. In most cases, the reverse-coded items (X3, X6, X7, X13, X18, X21) have negative or not significant loadings, indicating they have a negative or no relationship with the latent construct.
